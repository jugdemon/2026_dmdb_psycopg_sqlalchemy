# DMDB (DNDS5020)

This is a code repository for the course "Data Management and Databases" (DNDS5020) at Central European University. You are required to use VPN to access the server.

This repository introduces the basics for accessing a PostgreSQL server from python. The library psycopg is used (that is version 3 not 2). Some basic SQLAlchemy is also introduced.
